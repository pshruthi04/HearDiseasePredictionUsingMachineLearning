Support vector attained more accuracy than other models.
This project saves time and money for various tests performed in hospital if a person is not in a situation to visit hospital.
We can try normalization or tuning of features to improve the accuracy of model.

#### Challenge: 
This project is not 100% accurate. It gives correct results up to some extent. As this is mainly related to heart, some incorrect results may lead to different consequences. That needs to be taken care by balancing thin line between precision and recall.
Future Scope: Dataset used in this project has less records. Accuracy can be increased and better models can be generated by increasing the records in the dataset.
